# CS153-RecipesForAll

About

This app is designed to help anyone who has food restrictions find appetizing and filling recipes.

Developer Notes

To run on your own device, clone the project, navigate into the directory RecipesForAll, and run "npm install". 
Dependencies you may need to add include Async Storage. I plan to add other dependencies as well.
